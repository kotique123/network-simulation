Router setup
1. Basic device setup for ServerRoom router
	Hostname
	Console password
	Enable password
	Secret password
	Interfaces
	Description on interfaces
	Default gateway
2. Routing
	Static routing (implemented on a router in the server room on a router)
	ServerRoom-Router(config)#ip route 192.168.0.128 255.255.255.128 192.168.0.1
	do this for every single rack
	ServerRoom-Router(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 g0/0
	do that once or at the very end
3. DHCP setup
	Goals:
	Reserve addresses according to documentation
	Implement DHCP pool of addresses for clients with addresses accroding to documentation
	Test DHCP implementation
	Steps:
	1. Enable dhcp service
	Rack1-Router1(config)#service dhcp

	2. Exclude reserved addresses according to network documentation
	Rack1-Router1(config)#ip dhcp excluded-addresses 192.168.0.253 192.168.0.254

	3. Exit config mode and enter DHCP 'pool_name' mode
	Rack1-Router1(config)#ip dhcp excluded-addresses 192.168.0.253 192.168.0.254
	Rack1-Router1(config)#ip dhcp pool rack
	where 'rack' is name of pool according to network documentation(ex. Rack1)

	4. Set network address and default router address according to network documentation
	Rack1-Router1(dhcp-config)#network 192.168.0.128 255.255.255.128
	Rack1-Router1(dhcp-config)#default-router 192.168.0.254

	5. Set length of a DHCP lease
	Rack1-Router1(dhcp-config)#lease 7
	'7' means 7 days
	where the format is 'lease {days [hours [minutes]] | infinite}'

	6. Exit and save configuration. Test DHCP with client machines, utilzing cmd tools.
